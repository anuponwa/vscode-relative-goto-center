# relative-goto-center README


## Features

Inspiration from `relative goto` extension. At first, I wanted to adjust some behavior, but as I was editing, I ended up start fresh and rewrote the whole thing.

- Go to relative line and center -- Go to the beginning of the specified line and center
- Select to relative line and center -- Select whole lines startig where the cursor is currently at

Both `Go to` and `Select` will center after the command

With `Select to relative line and center`, it will select from the first character of the top line to the last character of the bottom line.

## Extension Settings

Currently, there are no extension settings. I should add in the future, e.g., to make it either center or not after the command is run.

## Known Issues

No known issues as of now.

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 0.0.1
